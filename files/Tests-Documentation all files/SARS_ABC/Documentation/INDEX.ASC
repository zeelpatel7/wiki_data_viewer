          School Archival records Search (SARS)
          2/17/95

          The School Archival Records Search (SARS) was created from the school records of children.  Some
          of the information it tracks can be found in other datasets.  Whenever the same information is to
          be found in several places, the values of the data should be the same, or how they differ should
          be documented so that researchers understand what they are getting.

          Among other things, the SARS tracks number of retentions, as does the Academic Retention and
          Special Services (AR&SS) dataset, and California Achievement Test (CAT) scores, also found in the
          Year 7 analysis dataset, YR7V28.SSD.  In fact, the Year 7 analysis dataset contains two sets of
          CAT scores, one for Grade 6 and one for Year 7 1.  The SARS scores are reading, math and language
          percentile scores and an overall percentile score, which is the average of the three percentile
          scores.

          The SARS data were entered for Years 7 and 10, and verified.  A dataset of SARS data was created
          consisting of the data from the two year datasets,  up to two obs/child.  The variables are
          listed:
                ID                      Child's ID
                YEAR                    Year of assessment
                GRADE                   Grade in year of assessment
                ELMSCHLS                # elementary schools attended
                MIDSCHLS                # middle schools attended
                HISCHLS         # high schools attended
                DAYSABST                # days absent for entire school year
                READTOT         Reading total national percentile on CAT
                READGR          Reading grade equivalence on CAT
                MATHTOT         Math total national percentile on CAT
                MATHGR          Math grade equivalence on CAT
                LANGTOT         Language total national percentile on CAT
                LANGGR          Language grade equivalence on CAT
                RETENTS         # retentions up to current grade level
                OVERALL         mean of percentile scores, READTOT, MATHTOT, LANGTOT

          The data are stored, as the retention data are, in their own subdirectory:
                K:\ABC\SARS.
          The most recent version of the dataset is SARS04.SSD.  The comparable Courtesy dataset is
          CSARS04.SSD.  All files have been zipped up.

          When the data for the two time periods were combined, and further, when the data were compared to
          what was thought to be the same data in other datasets, discrepancies arose.  In the previous
          document, dated 11/10/94, stored with the SARS notebook devoted to logs and outputs and in the
          notebook entitled, "Abecedarian, Follow-Up, Years 7 & 10, Documentation", these discrepancies were
          addressed, and resolved.  They are discussed here.
                1.  Retention data.  A note on the 11/10/94 document claims that discrepancies in retention
          data occurring within the SARS is a result of the Year 7 data being for that year
          only and the Year 10 being cumulative.   If that is the case, that wasn't the understanding at the
          time of data entry, nor is it consonant with what appears in the codebook and on the
          document.  Therefore, I'm assuming that it's not the case, and that the discrepancies
          between the years of SARS data for IDs 111 and 953 haven't been explained.

                     In regard to the discrepancies between the SARS and the AR&SS retention data, there is
          a very important consideration.  Apparently the criterion for identifying a child as
          having been retained was not the same for both datasets.  In the AR&SS, if a child had been
          "administratively retained", but, through attendance at summer school,  etc., went
          on to the next grade, that child was not considered a retention.  In the SARS,
          however, if a child were administratively retained, regardless of what ensued, the child was
          retained.  This would explain the discrepancy mentioned on the 11/10/94
          document for ID 101.  IDs 98, 111 and 941 need to be checked to see if their discrepancies are
          also explained by the differing criteria.

                2.  California Achievement Test scores.  The SARS tracked CAT percentile and
          grade-equivalent scores and the scores in the Year 7 analysis dataset are as described
          in footnote 1.  The overall percentile score in the SARS dataset, OVERALL, is really a useless
          variable.  If one wanted to look at an overall score, the best source would be the
          variable, CATPTOT6, in the Year 7 dataset, which is probably the percentile score corresponding to
          the mean of the raw scores for reading, math and language 2.  When the SARS data was
          compared with the CAT data in the Year 7 dataset, discrepancies were found
          (see output of A1094_08.PGM).  Some of the changes to the output assigned OVERALL the value of
          CATPTOT6.  I decided that such a change only fostered greater confusion, for some
          obs would have a value for this variable by one definition, and some obs would                     have
          a value determined by a different method.  Therefore, my solution was to drop this variable,
          OVERALL, from the SARS dataset entirely.  All other changes on the output were made
          in the programs K:\ABC\SARS\SARS04.PGM and K:\ABC\YEAR7\PROG\YR7V28.PGM.
          _______________________________
          1 The Grade 6 CAT scores are three percentile scores, for reading, math and language, and a total percentile score.  The
            Year 7 are the three percentile scores and three grade equivalences, not total score of any sort.

          2 No raw scores were entered, only percentile scores.
