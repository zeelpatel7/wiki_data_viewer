# UChicago Web Development Project

### Website link : https://jenni.uchicago.edu/Web_Dev/

A full-stack web application built with **React.js**, **Flask**, and **PostgreSQL** to streamline access to decades of historical research data for the University of Chicago's Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD).

## Project Overview

This application replaces a fragmented Google Drive system with a centralized, searchable interface, empowering non-technical researchers to efficiently explore, filter, and download data assets. Designed for usability, transparency, and long-term scalability.

## Features

- Modern, responsive UI built with **React.js**
- **Flask** API backend handling authentication, data queries, and file access
- **PostgreSQL** database to manage structured metadata and file indexing
- Role-based access to restrict or permit data downloads
- Keyword and tag-based search for quick data discovery
- Admin dashboard for file uploads and database updates

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Flask, SQLAlchemy  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Deployment:** (Add Heroku, Docker, or your deployment method if applicable)

## Motivation

CEHD's previous system relied on loosely organized Google Drive folders, which made data access and collaboration inefficient. This application brings structure and searchability to a large, valuable archive of research data.

## Impact

- Replaced scattered storage with a centralized, queryable interface  
- Enabled non-technical users to access research data intuitively  
- Improved data governance and reduced time spent searching for files
